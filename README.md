# Data-Warehouse-via-AWS

## Getting Started

### Dataset

The project will be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
- Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

#### Song data

The `Song data` is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```sh
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```python
{
    "num_songs": 1, 
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
    "artist_latitude": null, 
    "artist_longitude": null, 
    "artist_location": "", 
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
    "duration": 152.92036, 
    "year": 0
}
```

#### Log data

The `Log data` consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```sh
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And the data looks like

```python
{
    "artist":null,
    "auth":"Logged In",
    "firstName":"Walter",
    "gender":"M",
    "itemInSession":0,
    "lastName":"Frye",
    "length":null,
    "level":"free",
    "location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA",
    "method":"GET",
    "page":"Home",
    "registration":1540919166796.0,
    "sessionId":38,
    "song":null,
    "status":200,
    "ts":1541105830796,
    "userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"",
    "userId":"39"
}
```

### Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, we create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. The fact and dimension tables are designed as bellow:

![erd](assets/Songplay%20analysis.png)

Fact Table:

- songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
  - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

Dimension Tables:

- users - users in the app
  - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
- songs - songs in music database
  - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
- artists - artists in music database
  - artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
